# Hello Web World :globe_with_meridians:

This is the first official website I've built from a Web development course on Udemy. This course goes from beginner to advanced functions. It shows:
* HTML
* CSS (with grid and flexbox features)
* Javascript
* AJAX
* PHP 
* MySQL

I've used Netlify to deploy it and you can access with the following link:
